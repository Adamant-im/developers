# Task and PR Linking

To maintain a seamless workflow and improve traceability, it's essential to link GitHub pull requests (PRs) to their corresponding Trello tasks. This integration ensures:

- **Easy navigation**: Quickly jump between a Trello task and its associated PR.
- **PR status tracking**: Trello tasks display the PR's current status (e.g., Open, Merged, or Closed).
- **Automatic updates**: After linking, a comment is added to the PR referencing the Trello task.

## Enable Github integration in Trello

1. Open any task and click "Add Power-Ups"
2. Select: Github and connect the target repository

> This action must be performed only once.

## Link a task to the PR

1. Navigate to the relevant task on the [PWA Trello board](https://trello.com/b/tbpQhTTM/pwa).

2. Under "Power-Ups" click on "Github". Next "Attach Pull Request...". Select the PR that need to be linked.

**After linking:**

- Trello will display the status of the PR (Open, Merged, Closed) directly in the task.
- GitHub will automatically add a comment in the PR referencing the Trello task.
